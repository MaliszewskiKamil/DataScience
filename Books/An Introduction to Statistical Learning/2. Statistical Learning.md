Input variables are noted with X (radio budget, TV budget, internet budget, etc.)
Output variables are noted with Y (sales); inputs are called different names, such as <i> predictors, features, independent variables </i>

Y = f (X) + ![[Pasted image 20230929132045.png]]

Function f() can involve more than one input variable to show the real underlaying information. As an example we can provide two different plots for the relation between income and years of education that may look like this:

But there still may be an information behind that that will show the real representation of given data. If we provide f fucntion one more variable, **seniority** it will show the true representation that we are looking for:
